Running again to test after fixing bug of treating NER entities as OOV if not in word2vec vocab
Used same 10k articles from Run 2.

Future work: 
* switch from logistic regression to something that is sequence aware
* figure out how my current strategy of tokenizing NER can be fixed by using entity-level awareness
